# Introduction To Software Development 1

This hands-on course is designed for those with no previous programming experience and is also appropriate for experienced developers who want to learn to use modern object-oriented programming (OOP) languages to build applications. Using an "objects first" approach, students receive an intensive introduction to OOP concepts. Topics include classes and objects and their relationship, primitive data types, constructors, methods, repetition and selection, collections, abstraction and modularization. Upon successful completion, participants will have a basic understanding of programming concepts and objects, and be prepared to move on to COMP 1451 Introduction to Software Development 2.
